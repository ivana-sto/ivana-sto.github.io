                <p>My second hobby is painting flowers, almost exclusively on walls.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="img-box">
                <img src="img/f1.png" alt="#" />
            </div>

            <div class="flex-section">
                <div class="sub-title">Where can you see them?</div>

                <p>There is a cafe in Belgrade with about 9 meter long wall covered with my flowers. It can't be missed. If you happen to find yourself in that exact cafe, you will see it for sure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="img-box">
                <img src="img/f2.png" alt="#" />
            </div>

            <div class="flex-section">
                <div class="sub-title">Future plans</div>

                <p>It's always the same plan. I will paint a few more flowers and that is it. No more.</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    At the cafe, I mentioned above there is also an Ivy I painted, it doesn't have a single flower. That is how I envisioned it at first but after some time it started to look plain, so that Ivy needs a lot of flowers since
                    it is about 4meters tall and 3 meters wide.
