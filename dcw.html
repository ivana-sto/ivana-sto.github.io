      <div class="title"> Digital content warehouse</div>



      <p>I thoroughly enjoyed working on this web application with my design team. As proprietary tooling, it presented uniquely interesting design challenges within a feature-dense environment. Our primary focus was on maximizing the quality and usability of features to offer the most efficient workflows to our users—who, in this case, were also our colleagues.
      </p>
       <p>
      Because this was an in-house product developed specifically for internal teams, the level of dedication and commitment from everyone involved was exceptionally high, which made the process more rewarding and collaborative.
      </p>
       <p>
      I also worked closely with the front-end team to ensure that the design components were compatible with the front-end library, maintained clear communication with the back-end team to validate the feasibility and technical alignment of our design decisions. This close cross-functional collaboration was essential to delivering a well-integrated and user-centered product.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project holds special significance for me, as it was the first project through which I had the opportunity to lead that particular design team.    
      </p>

      <div class="sub-title">User groups</div>

          <p>There are 4 types of users in the DCW ecosystem:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Content Curators:</b><br>
                The largest group of DCW users, content curators manage and organize movies, series, music, and more. They decide what content is available by country and time period, and handle agreements for promotion, planning, and trend analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
                Licensing Team:<br>
                These users ensure all content has valid licensing for specific timeframes. They manage licenses, permissions, upload bulk metadata, edit existing data, and set automated alerts and content statuses.
           </li>
            <li>
              Translations Team:<br>
               This team handles all text materials that accompany content, text like descriptions, subtitles, song lyrics and region specific ratings. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Media Team:<br>
              The media team manages all visual and audio assets associated with content, including covers and trailers in various formats. They update media for both new and existing content, collaborating closely with the licensing and content curation teams.

            </li>
          </ul>

      <div class="sub-title">The process</div>
          <p>Together with my team I went through the following stages of the design process:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
             Research:<br> This crucial phase helped us define key user actions, workflows, pain points, and expectations across user groups. Common frustrations included filtering, bulk editing, and tag management, while all groups highlighted the lack of a clear overview as a major usability issue.
            </li>
            <li>
                Defining design strategy:<br> Feature prioritization followed user research, planning, and the definition of task-specific requirements.
           </li>
            <li>
             Ideation:<br> During this phase there was plenty of sketches, exchange of ideas, validation of userflows with users, discussions and votes.  
            </li>
            <li>
              Design and Prototyping:<br> We began this phase by creating a design system for DCW using the Material 3 Design kit, strictly following its guidelines and component structure. This ensured consistency, usability, and efficient development, as the Material system was chosen in collaboration with developers. I also closely reviewed the front-end Material library to ensure alignment between design and development components.

            </li>
            <li>
              Validation:<br> We conducted user interviews and usability tests in the staging environment, observing where users struggled to complete tasks or find features. Based on this, we designed a "Report Issue" feature and a "Lighthouse" tool that highlights unused areas of the app with animated hints.

            </li>
            <li>
              Handover and Dev support:<br> Although developers were fully involved throughout the design process and kept informed at every stage, I ensured that two designers were always available during development to answer questions and clarify design deliverables as needed. We maintained an open line of communication to support a smooth implementation.
            </li>
            <li>
             Launch, Validation, and Testing:<br> After the successful launch of the new DCW platform, the old version remained available, giving users time to adjust. Despite this, nearly all users quickly adopted the new platform, reporting high satisfaction and ease of use. Most notably, tasks that once took hours were now completed in minutes.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br>
          <p>We could now take a look at some of the most important features of DCW and the design system rules and principles.
          </p>
    </div>

    <div class="flex-section">

      <div class="sub-title">Material design system</div>

          <p>During the exploration, designers experimented with Material Design components, bringing early sketches to life and exploring various options. Material 3 Design Kit and the Material Theme builder, applied to the Material 3 Design Kit we so useful. Partly for styling exploration but also for having styles applied throughout all components, consistantly. 
          </p>

    <div class="flex-section">

      <div class="sub-title">Filtering and customisation</div>

          <p>AA better filtering system was essential. Users can now filter by ID, ID string, or custom criteria. A key improvement is the ability to show, hide, and customize filters, allowing users to tailor the interface to their needs and reduce cognitive load.
          </p>

    </div>

 <div class="flex-section">

      <div class="sub-title">Customised table</div>

          <p>We have also noticed that different users wanted to see the table of content differently and had individual needs. For example, some users wanted to see the thumbnail column and some didn’t—same for many other types of information. So, the design system contains different component variants, particularly related to dropdown menus, which enable customization. The result was that all users could adjust their table view to their needs and habits, seeing the information they needed and not seeing the information they did not want—unlike in the old version.
          <br>
          While I appreciated the visual appeal, it was equally important to ensure that all essential features were present, fully functional, highly usable, and aligned with Material Design principles.          
        </p>

        <div class="flex-section">

      <div class="sub-title">Bulk editing</div>

          <p>Bulk editing was one of the most requested features. Previously, users had to open each content item individually to make changes—like updating license settings, setting status, or publishing. With the new DCW design, they can now filter content, apply actions to entire search result/group with just a few clicks, and even save those groups for future use.
          </p>

    </div>

            <div class="flex-section">

      <div class="sub-title">Single content item editing</div>

          <p>Users still frequently need to edit individual content items, often to update descriptions or change images as they are key elements that influence how content is perceived by end users.
          </p>

    </div>

    <div class="flex-section">

      <div class="sub-title">Results</div>

          <p>The old content management application was replaced by a new, modernized platform. This transition dramatically transformed the way the company manages its products—reducing task times from hours to minutes and significantly lowering operational costs. 
          </p>

          <p>
          The quality of content across services improved in a short amount of time, offering end users a more polished streaming experience with fewer issues such as unavailable titles, incorrect languages, or irrelevant content recommendations.
          </p>  

          <p>
            In the following months, a new streaming service was launched in a fraction of the usual time. Thanks to the streamlined content management system that enabled fast content importing, editing, efficient curation, and simplified licensing configuration.
