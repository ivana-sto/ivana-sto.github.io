      <div class="title">Encouraging good deeds through technology</div>

      <p>Currently, I am designing an app for Ekviti, a non-profit organization. The app is intended for people who want to interact with other like-minded individuals around the topic of good deeds, keep a record of their own good deeds, encourage themselves and others to do more good, and generally be a positive voice in society.
      </p>
      <br> 
      <p> This case study will be written in more of a diary format, following the chronological progress I make with my team, rather than presenting a typical overview of the finished project.
      </p>

      <div class="sub-title">The goal</div>
          <p>The team has defined following goals as primary:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
             <b>Enable Social Connectivity Around Positive Actions</b><br> 
             Enable users to follow others and view and save posts related to good deeds, events, inspirational sayings, community challenges, and thought-provoking riddles, fostering a positive, engaged community.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Track and Share Meaningful Contributions</b><br> Enable users to post and keep a personal record of their own good deeds, participation in events, responses to challenges, and other uplifting content.
           </li>
            <li>
             <b>Implement a Flexible Reward System</b><br> Introduce a point-based system that lets users reward others not only for good deeds but also for meaningful events, inspirational sayings, creative challenges, and clever riddles—broadening the scope of what can be appreciated and encouraged.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Allow Users to Rate Content with Tiered Feedback</b><br> Provide users with the ability to rate posts using one of four predefined point levels, offering a simple yet structured way to express appreciation and highlight impact.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p> Bellow we can see a few tests and explorations how the core interaction inside the app could be structured inside a card component.

        <div class="flex-section">

      <div class="sub-title">Interaction features</div>


     <p> The importance of community and local relevance also drives us to dedicate significant effort to designing and developing interactive features, such as reactions, comments, replies, upvotes or likes and downvotes or dislikes, in order to enable rich and meaningful interaction within the app.
      </p>
     <br>
      <p> Bellow we can see some exploration screens for the comment section. 
      </p>

        <div class="flex-section">

      <div class="sub-title">Awards x interaction</div>


     <p> As social beings, humans naturally seek interaction. Online interaction like comments, likes, hearts feels rewarding. Within the Ekviti app, the idea is to enhence this by providing awards, a way to get and give points as one of the interaction types.      
     </p>

     <p>  
      Users can give each other awards, and those whose good deeds, challenges, riddles, or quotes are awarded highest will earn top scores within the app.
      </p>

     <p> While most apps use standard emojis, likes, or hearts for this purpose, we’re taking a more playful approach by introducing custom 3D emojis to represent points, essentially serving as awards.
     </p>

     <p> I tested various AI tools to create suitable 3D emojis for this type of interaction and found that Bnbicons has been the most effective tool so far.

      <div class="sub-title">Language and translations</div>


     <p> Many app interfaces today are only available in English unless they are fairly large, mature applications. However, since this app is rooted in community, local relevance, and cultural context, it will offer more language options than usual.
      </p>

      <div class="sub-title">Particularities of the project</div>


     <p> This project is non-profitable project, slowly being built during personal spare time of everyone on the team with a permanent desicision
      by the team to never generate profit through the app and only strictly serve the community. 
      </p>

        <p> A lot of core development, backend, app setup have been happening for quite some time, the team felt the need for a product designer to step in and help with creating an amazing, fun, encouraging app. Therefore, I do have to check a lot around backend capabilities, what has been delivered so far, and what will be in development in the future and when. 
       </p>

       <p>Azure Devops has been quite helpful and insightful, continuues to be useful for us as a team as we keep track of who is doing what and where we are at in general with this project.
